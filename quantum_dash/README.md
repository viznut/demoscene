# Quantum Dash (2014)

I seldom make games, but in 2014 I decided to participate in a gamemaking
competition called Ludum Dare 30. The goal was to write a game in 48 hours
based on a theme, and that year's theme was "Connected Worlds". I wanted to
try what I can do in a limited amount of time, and eventually I only used
about 12 hours (+8 hours for sleep) for making the game.

Quantum Dash is written from scratch in C/SDL. The player moves around in a
set of three grid-like parallel universes (press TAB to switch between
universes) with the ability to push stones and "cords" around. Unsupported
stones fall like in the classic game Boulder Dash. The goal is to move cords
so that they are in the same location in each parallel universe. Glitchy
sprites indicate anomalies (thing that are not there in the other
universes).
