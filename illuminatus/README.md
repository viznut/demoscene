# Illuminatus (2014)

This is a tribute to the Illuminatus, the April's Fools prank in the
MikroBitti magazine 4/1989, on its 25th anniversary.

Originally made for a single prank video ("Illuminatus gameplay (Atari ST)")
but later refurbished as a web-playable "cover disk game" of the first
English-language edition of the Skrolli magazine (2016.1E).

You can't really do much in it. Quick and dirty.

The graphics are based on the original faux screenshots by Petri Teittinen.
The 3D object in the intro was remodelled by BassCadet.
