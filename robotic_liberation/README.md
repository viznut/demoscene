# Robotic Liberation (2003)

A trackloader demo for an unexpanded Commodore VIC-20 and a Commodore 1541
disk drive. Takes about 16 kilobytes on the disk. Won the Oldskool Demo
competition at Assembly 2003.

The singing speech synthesizer is based on the one I developed for an
earlier demo, Robotic Warrior.

The graphics have been drawn with Brickshop (source code in brickshop.a65),
an editor running natively on the VIC-20. http://pelulamu.net/pwp/brickshop/

The music player uses "Viznut waveforms" I discovered earlier that year
(waveforms.txt documents the discovery).
