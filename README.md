# Selection of Viznut's demoscene source code (1997-2015)

Due to public interest, here is a collection of source code from some of my
demoscene productions and other one-shot projects from past decades.

Archival only, pull requests are not accepted.

DISCLAIMER: None of these are intended for reuse, even though some parts
have been used in multiple productions. Also, I very seldom considered the
possibility that anyone else would try to read the code. So, don't use them
as examples of how to organize code in real-world projects.

Included in separate subdirectories:
- dramatic_pixels: a minimalist 1-kilobyte story for the C-64
- false_dimension: pseudorandom-generative imagery in 2 kilobytes for the C-64
- helium: a story-driven 4-kilobyter for MS-DOS (386/VGA/Adlib)
- illuminatus: a 25th-anniversary tribute to a 1989 April Fool's prank (C/SDL)
- impossiblator_3: a multipart technical demo for the VIC-20
- next_level: streamed animation for the VIC-20
- quantum_dash: a quick entry for a game-making contest (C/SDL)
- robotic_liberation: a trackloader demo for the VIC-20
- robotic_warrior: a single-load demo for the VIC-20
