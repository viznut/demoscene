# Robotic Warrior (2003)

A single-load (~4K) demo for the Commodore VIC-20. Won the main demo
competition at the Alternative Party 2003.

The main technical point in this one is the singing speech synthesizer that
somewhat depends on the visible lyrics for its illusion. The graphics images
are compressed to 1 bit per visible 8x8-pixel character.
